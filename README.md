# Statically typed vs Dynamically typed

**Statically typed languages:**&#x20;

* Example: **C, C++, Java, TypeScript**
* The data type of a variable need to be specified during compile time&#x20;
* The return type of function as well as the type of variable it is taking or accepting need to be pre-define as well

**Dynamically typed languages:**&#x20;

* Example: **JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl**, etc
* Do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself
* Donâ€™t even need to specify the type of variable that a function is returning or accepting in these languages

|               | Static typed                            | Dynamically typed                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Advantages    | less bugs introduced in run time        | easier to write, less amount of codes need to be written |
|               | can run faster                          |                                                          |
| Disadvantages | more amount of codes need to be written | potential bug during run time                            |
